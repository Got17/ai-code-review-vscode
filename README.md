# AI-Powered Code Review Extension for VS Code

## 📌 Overview

This project is a VS Code extension that provides AI-generated code review suggestions for F# and WebSharper code. It analyzes selected code and suggests improvements in readability, performance, and maintainability using a locally hosted LLM.

## ✨ Key Features

- Accept/Reject interface with real-time feedback
- Git version control integration:
  - Accept → auto-commit
  - Reject → stage change only
- Fully local operation (no cloud dependency)
- Learns from user interaction to personalize future suggestions
